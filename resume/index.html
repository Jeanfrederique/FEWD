			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>
				<p>New York born but was raised in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, I eventually moved back to NY, where I attended St. John's University. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2008.
				</p>
				<p>In 2002, I joined the Marine Corps to be a communication specialist. Two years later, I got sent to Iraq and had some of the best time of my life.
				</p>
				<p>I haved worked in the tech industry professionally for over 6 years, and have worked on dozens of projects/platform, and have attempted to learn many programming languages in my career. My work consists of everything from tiny automated script to assist in building huge testing framework for multinational businesses.
				</p>
				<p>I am a casual investor, a outdoor fitness enthusiast, a photo tinkerer and I also enjoy a good video game when I have the time. I love traveling and have been to at least 10 countries. When I am not working or playing, I enjoy spending time with my friends, family and my dog, Lola.
